### Kia ora ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer with a background in IT looking for a role as a web developer. I recently transitioned to web development because of the incredible versatility it offers and the endless possibilities for solving real-world problems and creating value for users.

I have a strong commitment to continuous learning and growth. I am driven by the ever-evolving nature of the software development industry and am keen to adapt and acquire new skills. Whether it's a new programming language or a web design trend, I am eager to explore it.

Currently honing my knowledge of React, Javascript audio frameworks, and how design affects those that are neurodivergent. My learning is centered on the role that technology plays in our lives and how it helps to overcome barriers.

You will find a mix of projects from my studies at Dev Academy Aotearoa as well as some to satisfy my own curiosities.

Projects looking at starting:
- Beat Pixel 2.0 w/ Elementary Audio
- Todo App w/ Sveltekit
- ADHD accessibility research
